# Cursor Rules for Posey AI Development

## IMPORTANT
Critical requirements:
- Absolutely never under any circustance are you to code work-around when an error is encountered. You must always find and fix the root issue.
- Never create test users or test data unless specifically requested
- Always assume a production environment where we expect to have all data required, if something unexpected happens, you should find the root cause and not just the easiest solution to get around the error
- ALWAYS use yarn over npm

## Overview
We are building an agentic framework that enables the creation of specialized AI agents for various tasks.
Our architecture follows a monorepo structure using NX for efficient configuration and dependency sharing.
Primary development languages: TypeScript and Python.

## Core Technologies
### Infrastructure
- NX: Monorepo management
- Docker: Containerization and deployment
- CircleCI/ArgoCD: CI/CD pipelines
- Supertokens: Authentication & authorization
- Qdrant: Vector search & memory management

### Frontend
- Next.js 15: Web application framework
- React 19: Using the lates version of React as well as Next.js
- Electron: Desktop application framework
- DaisyUI + Tailwind CSS: Styling
- React Testing Library + Jest: Testing

### AI & Agents
- [Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev): Core agent capabilities
- Transformer models: NLP & understanding
- Vector databases: Semantic search
- Custom abilities plugin system

## Project Structure
- Use NX for monorepo management to share configurations and dependencies efficiently.
- Use Docker for containerization and deployment of services.
- Use Supertokens for authentication and authorization.
- Use Qdrant for vector search and memory management.
- Use Next.js for the web application.
- Use Electron for the desktop application.
- Use DaisyUI + Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Always use TypeScript for JavaScript projects and ensure strict type checking.
- Use Pydantic AI for basic agentic capabilities.

## General Guidelines
- Prioritize the use of open-source software and tools for development.
- Ensure all services and features are designed to be flexible and adaptable to future innovations.
- While open-source is preferred, maintain the ability to integrate with closed-source tools like ChatGPT or Claude when necessary.
- Always check for latest version and new cutting edge tools & technologies. Don't be afraid to try new things and think outside the box.

## Development Practices
- Follow a modular and reusable code structure to facilitate easy maintenance and expansion.
- Use NX for monorepo management to share configurations and dependencies efficiently.
- Implement continuous integration and deployment pipelines using CircleCI/ArgoCD.
- Ensure all code is written in TypeScript and follows functional and declarative programming patterns.

## AI and Agents
- Develop Posey as a central orchestrator for a swarm of specialized AI agents (we call these minions).
- Ensure minions are as autonomous as possible, with fallback mechanisms to request user input when needed.
- Use MCP to enhance agent communication and enable plugging in with other tools more easily
- Use transformer models and vector search for natural language understanding and information retrieval.

## Security and Privacy
- Implement end-to-end encryption for all sensitive data.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities and ensure security.
- Provide users with control over their data and interactions with the AI.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for user permissions.
- Conduct regular vulnerability scans and comprehensive security audits (automated and manual) to identify and mitigate risks.

## User Interaction
- Design Posey to provide personalized, context-aware assistance across various aspects of life and work.
- Ensure multi-platform support (web, mobile, voice) for seamless user interaction.
- Implement natural language processing for intuitive communication.
- Maintain a consistent and professional tone in all user interactions.

## Memory and Learning
- Develop a robust memory architecture to store and retrieve the AI's "life experiences."
- Implement feedback loops to improve AI responses based on user interactions.
- Use vector databases like Qdrant for semantic search and memory management.

## Documentation and Communication
- Maintain up-to-date documentation for setup, contribution guidelines, and API endpoints.
- Use JSDoc or TypeScript doc comments for code documentation.
- Ensure all communications are contextually relevant and personalized.

## Testing and Quality Assurance
- Write unit and integration tests for critical components using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Implement end-to-end testing and generate code coverage reports.
- Set up continuous integration (CI) pipelines to ensure code quality and coverage metrics are met.

## Performance Optimization
- Optimize for both web and mobile performance using techniques like lazy loading and code splitting.
- Use memoization techniques with `React.memo` and `useMemo` to enhance performance.
- Monitor performance using tools like WebPageTest and React Profiler.

## Key Conventions
- Use descriptive and meaningful commit messages.
- Ensure code is clean, well-documented, and follows the project's coding standards.
- Require pull requests to be reviewed by at least one other developer.
- Use issue tracking with clear labels and milestones.

## Continuous Improvement
- Implement a continuous learning and improvement pipeline for the AI.
- Allow for user feedback to improve AI interactions over time.
- Stay updated with the latest best practices and updates in AI and software development.

## Styling
- Use DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Prefer packages/ui for UI components by default and import them from there.
- Prefer packages/core for shared utilities and helpers.
- Ensure adherence to accessibility best practices (e.g., WCAG guidelines) for all UI components.
