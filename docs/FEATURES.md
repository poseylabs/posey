# Posey AI Assistant

Posey is a personalized AI companion designed to assist with all aspects of your life. Family, work, friends, and everything in between. This document outlines the key features and architecture of the Posey AI system.

Posey is designed to be a lifelong AI companion, growing and adapting with the user to provide personalized, context-aware assistance across various aspects of life and work. She can help with budgets, manage investments, plan meals and order groceries, and even help with your physical health. Posey can help you design your dream home, plan your next vacation, and even help you with your diet and exercise regimen. Posey can help you learn a new skill, like coding or playing the guitar, and keep a journal of your daily activities and experiences. Posey can help you with your career, managing your inbox, and even helping you with your job search.

Posey should learn over time and suggest improvements to it's own systems. Eventually, it will be give a sandboxed environment with access to a database of information and a set of tools to manipulate that information, and GPU's to train new AI agents. 

Posey will ave deep integration with the real world. It will be able to control your smart home devices, manage your schedule, and even help you with your diet and physical health. Posey will also have the ability to generate realistic synthetic data, such as photos, videos, and audio. This synthetic data will be used to train Posey's AI models, allowing it to better understand the nuances of human language and behavior.

"Posey" is the persona given to our AI system, but, it will really be an orchestrator for a swarm of custom AI agents. We will use the language "skills" to message to the user what our abilities are. The agents will all work together to simplify the life of their human family. They will work as a team, but Posey is the boss. Agents will have a host of skills, but only Posey (ue the user) will have permission to trigger most agents (some special agents will ve granted automonous background activities, for things like cron jobs or scheduled tasks)

## Core Features

1. **Task Management and Delegation**
   - Posey acts as the central hub for managing user requests
   - Delegates tasks to specialized AI agents
   - Consolidates results for seamless user interaction

2. **Continuous Learning and Personalization**
   - Learns from user interactions and feedback
   - Adapts its personality and responses over time
   - Maintains a comprehensive understanding of the user's life, goals, and preferences

3. **Multi-domain Assistance**
   - Scheduling and time management
   - Document analysis and information retrieval
   - Meal and workout planning
   - Business and personal goal management
   - Coding assistance and code review
   - Game design and world-building support
   - Smart home device management
   - Financial management
   - Travel planning
   - Life coaching and personal development

4. **Long-term Memory and Insights**
   - Build an Episodic Memory Architecture
   - Stores and retrieves relevant information from past interactions
   - Provides daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly summaries of user activities and accomplishments
   - Tracks long-term goals and vision, offering periodic updates and insights

5. **Flexible Interaction**
   - Natural language processing for intuitive communication
   - Multi-platform support (web, mobile, voice)
   - Customizable personality and name

## Architecture
Our system will be built as a monorepo using NX. This will allow us to easily share configuration and dependencies between our apps and packages.


1. **Monorepo Structure**
   - Initial models will come from hugging face or ollama, but over time, we will fine tune and train our own models
   - Modular design for easy expansion and maintenance
   - Models and LLM's are mostly in Python and built on PyTorch
   - UI built with Nextjs and TypeScript
   - Desktop app will be built with Electron or Tauri
   - Mobile app will be built with React Native
   - Deployments will be orchestrated by Github Actions
   - Deployable applications should be built as Kubernetes pods
   - The monorepo should leverage reusable components as often as possible

2. **AI Core**
   - Utilizes transformer models for natural language understanding and generation
   - Implements vector search for efficient information retrieval

3. **Specialized Agents**
   - Any specialized skills that require real-world interaction or a direct API to an external device will be built as their own agent. Examples include:
      - An agent with access to the local file system who can catalog and search local files
      - Programming assistant that can run code and make direct edits to local files
      - Design assistant that can create mockups and create initial wire-frames in Figma
      - Shop manager that can manage products and maintain shopping websites
      - Smart Home managements
      - Prompt writing assistant that will rewrite user input into meta prompts behind the scenes (must be able to be disabled by user)
      - Investment management that can buy and sell stocks and crypto in a sand-boxed account
      - Gardening assistant
      - Pet care assistant
      - School Tutor
      - Family Calendar
      - Shopping Assistant with access to a credit card that can place orders on our behalf
      - Business Manager that can craft business ideas
      - Startup Founder that can research and analyze new business ideas, draft business documents
      - Accountant
      - Songwriter
      - API Orchestrator. An agent who can learn how to use specific API's when given a documentation link and tell us what it needs to connect (usually an API key)
   - Posey will handle the conversation flow between the user and the agents
   - Create an extensible "abilities" plugin system for adding new skills
   - When possible, agents should be autonomous as much as possible. For example, if the API agent want to connect to an API, it should attempt to register for a new account and create a new API key on it's own. As a fallback, it can as Posey to inform the user that it needs a new API key and ask the user to create one.

4. **Persistent Memory**
   - Vector database (Qdrant) for semantic search
   - Relational database (PostgreSQL) for structured data storage
   - Local Cache (RocksDB) for storing user data and preferences
5. **External Integrations**
   - APIs for connecting with third-party services (e.g., smart home devices, financial institutions)
   - These will be built as ability plugins in the beginning, but ideally we will create an API agent that can learn how to interact with any API out there so we don't have to manually create a new integration for each new API.

6. **Security and Privacy**
   - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
   - Local deployment options for simplified testings
   - Regular backups and data portability

## Development Roadmap

1. Implement core Posey agent with basic task delegation
2. Develop robust memory and retrieval system
3. Create initial set of specialized agents and RAG's (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
4. Build user interface for web and mobile platforms
5. Implement security measures and data privacy controls
6. Develop continuous learning and improvement pipeline
7. Expand capabilities through additional specialized agents and integrations

Posey aims to be a lifelong AI companion, growing and adapting with the user to provide personalized, context-aware assistance across various aspects of life and work.
