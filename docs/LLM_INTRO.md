# Posey AI Overview
--------------------------------
Posey is a personalized AI companion designed to assist human users across various aspects of life, including family, work, and personal development. They aim to be a lifelong companion, adapting and growing with the user to provide context-aware assistance.


## Core Features/Goals:
--------------------------------

1. Task Management and Delegation: Posey acts as the central orchestration agent "assistant", managing user requests and delegating tasks to other more specialized AI agents (we call these minions) when needed.

2. Continuous Learning and Personalization: Learns from interactions, adapting its personality and responses over time.

3. Multi-domain Assistance: Offers help in scheduling, document analysis, meal planning, financial management, and more.

4. Long-term Memory and Insights: Has a robust internal memory system. Stores and retrieves information from past interactions, keeping most important context at the forefront, and capable of providing summaries and tracking goals.

5. Flexible Interaction: Supports natural language processing and multi-platform communication (web, mobile, voice).

6. Deep system integration: Able to integrate with and control many external systems and devices including but not limited to:
  - Smart home devices
  - Financial systems
  - Investment platforms
  - Calendar and scheduling systems
  - External APIs for additional functionality
  - Software on a specific machine (i.e. can open files in a specific code editor, or control a specific software applications on mobile, desktop or other devices)


## System Architecture:
--------------------------------
- Monorepo Structure: Built using NX for shared configuration and dependencies. The UI is developed with Next.js and TypeScript, while the backend leverages Python, PyTorch for AI models and Pydantic AI for our agentic system base.

- Uses a containerized approach to services using docker to easily package and deploy services our system relies on such as API's & databases.

- AI Core: Utilizes transformer models and vector search for efficient information retrieval.

- Specialized Minions: Includes minions for image & video generation, internet research, smart home management, investment, gardening, and more, each with specific skills.

- Persistent Memory: Uses Qdrant for semantic search and PostgreSQL for structured data storage.

- Security and Privacy: Implements end-to-end encryption and local deployment options for testing.

- Uses a flexible model architecture that can be easily extended with new specialized agents as needed. We will build a simple API interface that can abstract away the specific implementation details of each agent, allowing for easy addition of new agents in the future. This allows use to use publicly available API's such an ChatGPT, Gemini or Claude, or locally hosted models using services like Ollama. Our agents, minions and systems should not know or care what specific model or service is being used, they should just need to know how to interact with the API and provide the same level of help and assistance to the human and other agents regardless of the underlying implementation.


## Current Infrastructure:
--------------------------------
- Server Specs: Intel i7-12700KF CPU, 128GB DDR5 RAM, NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti GPU, and a combination of SSD and HDD storage.
- Containers: Includes containers for the web application, speech service, vector database, and model server, each serving specific roles within the architecture.
- Development environment: Macbook Pro M1 Silicon, 16GB


## Development Roadmap
--------------------------------

1. Implement core Posey orchestrator with task and agent delegation.
2. Develop memory and retrieval systems.
3. Create specialized minions and RAG.
4. Build user interfaces for web and mobile.
5. Implement security measures.
6. Develop continuous learning pipelines.
7. Expand capabilities with additional agents and integrations.


## Key Considerations
--------------------------------
- Security: Ensure container security and performance optimization.
- Ethical AI: Comply with ethical guidelines and data protection regulations.
- Continuous Improvement: Implement feedback loops for AI learning and user interaction improvements.
